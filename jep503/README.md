**Remove the 32-bit x86 Port**

 (https://openjdk.org/jeps/503)
        
JEP 503 does not introduce any new language features. The Java will no longer
support 32-bit hardware. The JEP states the cost of maintaining a 32-bit port
of Java is very costly with little benefit because there is little 32-bit only
left in the world :)
